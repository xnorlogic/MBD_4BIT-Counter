# MBD_4BIT-Counter
4BIT counter for PIC16F73 created with the Model Based Design on Simulink. This is a simple 4 bit counter interfaced with LEDs at the end of the micro to reveal counter status.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate/simulate the application on a small micro of the autoCode generation and to show how to create a deplyment code to the micro.
The model was generated in Matlab R2011 7.13.0.564
The model right now is set up for the PIC16F73 but it can be modified for any PIC16.
